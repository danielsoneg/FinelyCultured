title: Some Notes on Money

With a massive deficit and a crippling recession afoot, I think it's helpful to consider the nature of money. If you've a passing familiarity with the field of economics, much of this will likely be remedial, but I find it useful to refresh every now and again, as money can become a concept rather divorced from itself in the face of heated debate. If you're new to the subject, I hope this will be illuminating.

# What is Money?
The simple answer is, money is what we make of it. There are some fundamental precepts money must follow, but these are largely driven by perception, even when dealing with 'hard money' such as silver and gold.
More broadly, Money has three fundamental purposes:
1. A medium of exchange
2. A unit of account
3. A store of value

## Money as a Medium of Exchange
The first - and I would argue most important - use for money was as a medium of exchange. In a barter economy, trade is neccessarily symmetric, which means if someone who has an item you want doesn't want any of the items you have, you cannot affect an exchange. Likewise, if someone else wants an item of yours, but has nothing you want, the exchange cannot be executed. Money allows trades to be executed through a third common commodity: I can exchange corn for shells, which I can then exchange for bread, even if the man who traded for my corn has no bread. In short, as an exchange medium, money disaggregates the two sides of a transaction.

Historically, the first solution to this problem was debt: Bob is owed three ears of corn by Sally, an obligation he can pass to another in exchange for other goods. This system of debts, however, requires either good relationships or good bookkeeping (the first use of written language), and a closed system in either case. Money allows traders to carry their debts and credits between systems: as long as the currency of choice is recognized in two different markets, trust relationships are not required to carry over between the two.

## Money as a Unit of Account
As a unit of account, money allows different items and services to be valued on a consitent scale: whereas a barter system may
